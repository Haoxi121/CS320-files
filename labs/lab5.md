# Lab 5: BST

1. We have the detailed mortgage dataset we're using for P2 thanks to the 1975 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. Discuss with your group: *If you could pass a law requiring the collection and release of a new dataset, what data would you choose?* Feel free to answer based on what you think would be fun or interesting, or you can think about how your dataset might bring more transparency to a societal issue (like how the HDMA data makes it easier to monitor for discriminatory lending practices).

2. Inside your `CS320-FA23` repo, there is a notebook `/labs/debug/self/main.ipynb`. Open it and fix the bugs. 

3. Create a [binary search tree](./bst-groups) for use in P2.
