# Lab 1: VM Setup

1. Find your group. You can find your group info in your [Canvas Inbox](https://canvas.wisc.edu/conversations#filter=type=inbox). Ask your TA/peer mentor if you need help finding your group members.

2. Get to know your group members, asking each other the following:

- Name + major
- What is your hometown, and what is your favorite place there?
- If you could create a silly law, what would it be?

3. Setup your [virtual machine](./vm)
